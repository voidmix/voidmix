# Voidmix Repository Instructions

## Scope

These instructions apply to the entire repository. Every workspace also has its
own `AGENTS.md` whose rules apply only within that subtree and add more specific
constraints. The nearest file wins; it never contradicts this one.

## Read first

1. This file.
2. The `AGENTS.md` of the workspace being changed — it owns that workspace's
   interface, ownership, constraints, and verification commands.
3. `docs/README.md`, then the focused architecture or development document for
   the area being changed.
4. [Coding agents](docs/development/agents.md) for the read order, default
   decisions, and verification checklist.

Treat implementation and current tests as the final source of truth when a
document is stale, then update the document in the same change.

## Repository shape (dependencies flow downward only)

```text
apps        web, desktop, api, storybook    composition roots; never imported
adapters    api-runtime, client, contracts, i18n, ui  surfaces apps are allowed to use
core        db, domain, auth, mail      db implements interfaces owned by domain
foundation  env, logger, tsconfig       no dependency on anything above
tooling     scripts, e2e                never imported by runtime code
```

Each workspace's own `AGENTS.md` states its purpose, interface, and constraints.
This listing is exhaustive: `bun run policy` fails if a workspace is missing from
it, if it names one that does not exist, or if a directory appears under `apps/`
or `packages/` without a `package.json`.

## Architecture rules

- Frontend applications access backend behavior through `@voidmix/client` and
  `@voidmix/contracts`; they never import `@voidmix/db`.
- `@voidmix/domain` stays independent of React, Hono, Nitro, and Drizzle.
- `@voidmix/db` hides Drizzle implementation details behind repository
  interfaces owned by the domain.
- `@voidmix/api-runtime` performs final authentication and authorization checks;
  Web and the standalone API are hosting shells for that boundary.
- Admin-specific routes, tables, filters, and layouts stay in
  `apps/web/src/features/admin`
  until another real consumer justifies extraction.
- Runtime applications never import `@voidmix/scripts`.
- Do not add `apps/worker`, a background daemon, or a shared package without a
  concrete requirement and stable seam.

## Toolchain

- Use Bun `1.4.0` for installation, the lockfile, and repository scripts.
- Use the root Bun catalogs for third-party dependency versions and
  `workspace:*` for internal packages.
- Do not introduce another task orchestrator alongside Vite+.
- Oxlint and Oxfmt ship inside Vite+ and are configured in `vite.config.ts`. Use
  `bun run lint` and `bun run format`. Do not add a separate linter, formatter,
  or git-hook manager; `vp hooks enable` opts into the staged-file hook locally.
- Node.js `24.18.0` is the initial production server runtime; Tauri uses Rust.
- Keep Bun-specific types or APIs local to Bun workspaces rather than shared
  TypeScript presets.
- Prefer root scripts to global tools so the repository-local versions run.

## Code and generated files

- The repository is ESM-first and TypeScript-strict. Preserve the compiler
  options provided by `@voidmix/tsconfig`.
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` is on, so `{ key: undefined }` is illegal. Use
  conditional spread: `{ limit, ...(query ? { query } : {}) }`.
- `verbatimModuleSyntax` is on, so type-only imports need `import type`.
- A status or audit-action value is declared in **three** places with no shared
  source: a literal union in `@voidmix/domain`, a `z.enum` in
  `@voidmix/contracts`, and a `pgEnum` in `@voidmix/db`. Missing one fails at
  runtime, not at compile time.
- Relative import extensions are inconsistent per file. Mirror the neighbouring
  import rather than reasoning about it.
- Keep package interfaces small and avoid cross-layer imports for convenience.
- Use `bun run generate` for Drizzle artifacts. Route trees belong to the
  TanStack Start Vite plugin and are produced by `dev` or `build`; there is no
  standalone route-tree command, because the router CLI omits the Start
  `Register` footer.
- Do not hand-edit `routeTree.gen.ts` or generated Drizzle metadata unless the
  task is specifically about repairing generated output. `.prettierignore` keeps
  the formatter away from both for the same reason.
- Preserve unrelated changes in a dirty worktree. Never reset, overwrite, or
  delete user changes to simplify a task.

## UI conventions

- Reusable primitives live in `packages/ui`; page composition and
  application-specific navigation stay in the owning application.
- Do not introduce Radix primitives or Lucide icons without a recorded
  architecture decision under `docs/architecture/decisions/`.

See [`packages/ui/AGENTS.md`](packages/ui/AGENTS.md) for the primitive
conventions, the two file layouts, and the accessibility requirements.

## Logging, security, and data

- Use `@voidmix/logger` instead of application-local logger configuration.
- Keep operational logs separate from durable Admin audit records.
- Never log credentials, cookies, authorization headers, passwords, secrets,
  tokens, or API keys.
- Admin writes must preserve authorization, audit, self-suspension, and
  final-administrator protections.
- Destructive database scripts are limited to explicit development/test
  environments.

## Testing

Run the workspace's own narrowest test first — its `AGENTS.md` names it — then
one command for everything else:

```bash
bun run verify
```

`verify` is the whole gate: policy, format, lint, per-workspace checks, tests,
builds, and the Nitro runtime probe, cheapest first. The other scripts exist to
narrow a failure down, not to be run in sequence:

| verify fails at  | iterate with                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| policy           | `bun run policy:fix`, then read what it could not fix  |
| format or lint   | `bun run format:fix`, then `bun run lint`              |
| check or test    | that workspace's own command, named in its `AGENTS.md` |
| build or runtime | `bun run --cwd apps/<app> build`                       |

`bun run test:e2e` and `bun run doctor` stay outside it: one needs a Playwright
browser, the other asserts machine prerequisites and cannot run in CI. CI runs
`verify` and adds only what needs a clean git tree, a browser, or another
operating system.

Every application and test-bearing package owns an independent
`vitest.config.ts`. Preserve that boundary, never rely on a globally installed
`vp`, and leave `@voidmix/e2e` outside `bun run test`. Most `test` scripts carry
`--passWithNoTests`, so confirm a new test actually ran.

The runner is `vp test --run`; there is no direct `vitest` dependency, because
Vite+ bundles it and the test API is imported from `vite-plus/test`. Deleting a
workspace's `vitest.config.ts` admits its application Vite plugins into the
runner and breaks React 19 — the configs are load-bearing, not boilerplate.

The four `test:*` layer scripts are byte-identical across every workspace that
owns a `vitest.config.ts`, and `bun run policy` holds them there. They select a
layer with vitest's positional **substring filter**; a glob in that position
matches nothing and still exits 0.

[Testing and verification](docs/development/testing.md) is the authoritative
command list and explains the layer table, the reasons behind the boundary, and
Desktop's native checks.

## Documentation

- Update the workspace's own `AGENTS.md` when its interface, ownership,
  constraints, or verification commands change. Keep those files at or below 120
  lines and link to `docs/` instead of growing them.
- Update the focused file under `docs/architecture/` or `docs/development/` when
  architecture, tooling, commands, testing, or deployment behavior changes.
- Keep `docs/README.md` as the navigation index.
- `bun run policy` enforces these rules mechanically: workspace `AGENTS.md`
  structure and line cap, the workspace listing above, every relative
  documentation link, the project-skill wiring, workspace `.gitignore` anchoring,
  the `package.json` script and dependency contracts, and TypeScript preset
  inheritance. It fails on errors and prints warnings without failing.
