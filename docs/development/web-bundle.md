# Web Bundle Baseline

Run the reproducible report after a production build with:

```bash
bun run --cwd apps/web build
bun run --cwd apps/web bundle:analyze
```

The command reads the generated TanStack Start manifest and reports the entry
chunk, the unique `__root__` + `/` preload closure, HTML module script count,
initial request count, and level-9 gzip estimates for a cold cache. It is
read-only and never edits build output.

The home route's bundle budget is measured from the TanStack Start build
manifest, not from the largest emitted filename alone. Add the unique preloads
for `__root__` and `/`; those files form the initial JavaScript download for the
home route. Deferred chunks that are absent from both preload lists do not count
until their interaction imports run.

## August 27, 2026 baseline

The comparison below uses the same dependency installation and React Compiler
configuration on both sides. The before build restores only the synchronous
LanguageSwitcher and Composer attachment menus. Gzip totals use the same level-9
compression for every emitted file.

| Home client assets | Before menu split | After menu split |   Change |
| ------------------ | ----------------: | ---------------: | -------: |
| Initial JavaScript |         932.33 kB |        812.08 kB |   -12.9% |
| Initial gzip       |         280.82 kB |        241.76 kB |   -13.9% |
| Main `index` chunk |         662.19 kB |        662.27 kB |    +0.0% |
| Dropdown runtime   | 114.98 kB initial |  115.00 kB async | deferred |

The main chunk is the shared framework and router entry, so menu extraction is
not expected to shrink that individual file. The improvement is that the home
route no longer preloads the shared Dropdown Menu runtime. Language and Composer
add small interaction chunks (about 0.93 kB and 7.91 kB respectively) and share
one Dropdown Menu runtime after the first menu interaction.

The follow-up root-entry optimization moves client logger initialization behind
hydration and idle scheduling. In the August 27, 2026 build it changes the home
preload closure from 812.08 kB raw / 241.76 kB gzip to 809.67 kB raw / 240.61 kB
gzip. The logger is emitted as a separate approximately 2.87 kB client chunk;
the gain is intentionally modest because the logger is a small, non-critical
root dependency.

When repeating the measurement:

1. Run `bun run --cwd apps/web build`.
2. Read `.output/server/_tanstack-start-manifest_v-*.mjs`.
3. Sum the unique files in the `__root__` and `/` preload arrays, recording raw
   and gzip sizes.
4. Confirm `dropdown-menu` remains absent from the `/` preload list and is an
   import of the language, theme, and attachment menu chunks.

## August 31, 2026 RSC trial

The ActivitySection trial was measured from the same source state in both
configurations. RSC added a server-component Flight runtime and did not reduce
the home route's initial client download:

| Build        | Entry gzip | Initial JS gzip | Requests |
| ------------ | ---------: | --------------: | -------: |
| RSC enabled  |  134.98 kB |       183.77 kB |       18 |
| RSC disabled |  127.47 kB |       175.66 kB |       17 |

The trial was removed and the Web build remains RSC-disabled. The current
client-only home build measures 126.10 kB entry gzip and 170.61 kB across the
unique initial JS preload closure. The entry is below the previous 137.7 kB
single-file budget, while the closure remains the authoritative metric for
future comparisons.

## Locale catalog split

The Web root loader includes only the negotiated locale catalog for SSR. The
other catalog must be absent from the unique `__root__` and `/` preload closure
and emitted behind the locale switcher's async import. Verify this from the
build manifest after setting a request Cookie or `Accept-Language` for each
supported locale.

Keep the split enabled while either condition holds: Web supports at least three
locales, or the non-current locale contributes at least 10 KiB gzip to the home
route's initial preload in the comparison build. Below that threshold, the
additional async switching state is not justified by the catalog size.

Do not add manual chunk names or change the React Compiler merely to silence the
large-chunk warning. A useful split changes the route's initial preload closure;
moving bytes between filenames without changing that closure is not an
improvement.
